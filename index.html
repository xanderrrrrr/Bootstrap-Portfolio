                        <p>Hello, my name is Xander Cañedo Gonzalez! I have two last names because I am Mexican,
                            and in Mexico we carry on the Spanish tradition of having both paternal and maternal last
                            names.
                            I was born in New Jersey, but I have roots in San Diego, California and the city of
                            Guadalajara
                            in Mexico. However, I've called Salt Lake City home for the past 25 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love to travel, eat good food, make good drinks, and generally live life to the fullest.
                            I've been with my girlfriend, Elise, for about a year and a half. She's a native Utahn
                            hailing
                            from Utah County, however she's seen what Salt Lake has to offer and likely won't be going
                            back
                            any time soon, despite the fact that we both work in Lehi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I work for a project management SaaS company doing white-glove tech support. I'm well versed
                            in
                            consuming our own REST API (and I'm really exicted to be working on creating them further
                            down
                            the
                            course!),
                            as well as waterfall, agile, and kanban mangement methodologies. I work closely with our QA
                            and
                            Dev team
                            because
                            we need to collaborate so that we can deliver functionality our customers can rely on, as
                            well
                            as a
                            product that we can tout. I'm not too fond of it. And I can't wait to get out of it. My
                            career
                            path was
                            to move to QA Automation within my company but I recently did not get a position of Quality
                            Engineer, so
                            I've decided to take this course to expand my skills.
