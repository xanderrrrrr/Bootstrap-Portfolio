                <p style="clear-both">Hello, my name is Xander Cañedo Gonzalez! I have two last names because I am
                    Mexican,
                    and in Mexico we carry on the Spanish tradition of having both paternal and maternal last names.
                    I was born in New Jersey, but I have roots in San Diego, California and the city of Guadalajara
                    in Mexico. However, I've called Salt Lake City home for the past 25 years.
                    <br>
                    I love to travel, eat good food, make good drinks, and generally live life to the fullest.
                    I've been with my girlfriend, Elise, for about a year and a half. She's a native Utahn hailing
                    from Utah County, however she's seen what Salt Lake has to offer and likely won't be going back
                    any time soon, despite the fact that we both work in Lehi.

                <p>
                    I work for a project management SaaS company doing white-glove tech support. I'm well versed in
                    consuming our own REST API (and I'm really exicted to be working on creating them further down the
                    course!),
                    as well as waterfall, agile, and kanban mangement methodologies. I work closely with our QA and Dev
                    team
                    because
                    we need to collaborate so that we can deliver functionality our customers can rely on, as well as a
                    product that we can tout. I'm not too fond of it. And I can't wait to get out of it. My career path
                    was
                    to move to QA Automation within my company but I recently did not get a position of Quality
                    Engineer, so
                    I've decided to take this course to expand my skills.</p>
